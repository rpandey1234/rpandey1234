### Hi there 😇

I'm the cofounder of [Taro](https://jointaro.com/), a rockstar career mentor in your pocket. Taro is a collection of the best wisdom from engineers and managers at the top tech companies. The question we asked was simple: "What do we wish we knew earlier in our careers?" 

What I'm currently working on: 
- Building [Taro](https://jointaro.com/) to be the premier destination for career growth.
- I run the Tech Career Growth community on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/techcareergrowth/shared_invite/zt-lt2tbjcn-LOAVIDuGPI~nkuc4woHDLg) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/techcareergrowth/) with my cofounder Alex.
- I teach the Android class at Stanford: https://cs194a.stanford.edu/
- I make YouTube videos about accelerating your tech career: https://www.youtube.com/rpandey1234
- Previously, I worked at Facebook in Menlo Park as an Android Tech Lead, and before that at Pinterest in San Francisco.
