### Hi there 😇

I love helping people become the best engineer they can be. What I'm currently doing: 
- I run the Tech Career Growth community on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/techcareergrowth/shared_invite/zt-lt2tbjcn-LOAVIDuGPI~nkuc4woHDLg) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/techcareergrowth/) with my friend Alex.
- I teach the Android class at Stanford: https://cs194a.stanford.edu/
- I make YouTube videos about accelerating your tech career, along with tactical Android tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/rpandey1234
- I work at Facebook in Menlo Park as an Android Tech Lead

I'm based in California and always open to meeting people working on interesting things.
